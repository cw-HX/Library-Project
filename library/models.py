"""ARCHIVE: original Django ORM models.

This file was retained during the migration to MongoDB. The active
application models now live in `library/mongo_models.py`. The original
models are archived in `library/models_orm.py` for reference.

Do not use this module in production â€” it remains only for historical
reference and manual exports if needed.
